Reliability:
------------

    Ability to Bounce  back
    Recover from issues automatically
    Scale horizontally for resilliency
    Reduce idle resources

    Workloads that meets business requirements,regardless

    Limits
    Networking
    Availability


    Building on strong foundation
    Strong Network Topology
    Highly available
    Redundancy
    Manage your IP address
    Hub and spoke designs
    Service Quotas




    Areas of Focus
    --------------
    
     - Service oriented Architecture
     - Design to prevent failure


     - Segment your workload smartly
     - Provide service contracts via an API
     - What kind of distributed systems fits the purpose
     - Loosely couple dependencies when possible
     - responses are always idempotent
     - Do constant work


     Plan to Fail:
     -------------

        - Degrade systems gracefully
        - Throttle requests when necessary
        - Implement a smart retry system
        - Fail fast and limit queues
        - Stateless usually wins

    
    Backups and Restore:
    --------------------

     - What can be backed up and what can recreated
     - Automating backup and Restore


     - Deploy your resources to multiple locations
     - Automate recovery within a single location
     - use bulkheads to stop cascade failure

     - Monitor all componenets for failures
     - Use static stability
     - Notify teams for impact Availability


     Test and Practice:
     ------------------

         - Playbooks
         - blame-free-incident-analysis
         - Test functional requirements
         - 


    Plan Ahead (Disastor Recovery)
         - Test and Practice
         - Manage config drift
         - Automate everything

         - End to end tracing
         - Adapt to changes quickly
         - Smart alerts that are actionable
         - Longer term analytics
         - Regular Reviews
         - Scale resources automatically
         - Scale out based on demand
         - Load Testing
         


     Automated everything:
     --------------------
        - Automate all things
