5 Pillars:
----------

 - Operational Excellence
 - Security
 - Cost Optimization
 - Reliability
 - Performance Efficiency


 Operational Excellence:
 -----------------------
 
    - All Operations are code
    - Automation is Key
    - Documentation is updated automatically
    - Make small changes that you can rollback
    - Iterate a lot
    - Expect things to go sideways
    - Learn from Failures and success


Security:
---------

    - Identity has least privileges
    - Know who did what when
    - Security is woven into the fabric of the system
    - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
    - Prepare for the worst


Cost Optimization:
------------------

    - Consumption based pricing
    - Measure Efficiency consistently
    - Let AWS do the work whenever possible


Reliability:
-----------

     - Automated everything
     - Scale horizontally
     - Reduce idle resources
     - Manage changes through Automation


Performance Efficiency:
-----------------------

    - Let AWS do the work whenever possible
    - Reduce latency through edge and regions
    - Serverless FTW!
    - Experimenting new services
