Security:
---------

    - Is your workload is working as intended
    - Security is the ability to protect data, system and assets



    - Identity - Should have least privileges as possible 
    - Who did what when
    - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
    - 

5 Major Principles:
-------------------

    - Identity and Access
    - Detective control
    - Infra Protection
    - Data Protection
    - Incident Response



Security - Identity:
--------------------

    - Accounts
    - Human and machine identities
    - Managing Permissions


Accounts:
---------

    - Best way to setup Hard Boundary
    - AWS Organizations
    - Standardize Configurations
    - Centralized Resources

    - Manage with groups and attributes
    - User strong login (MFA) and Roles
    - Audit and Rotate credentials


    Permissions:
    -------------

        - Deny and Allow
        - Setup Guardrails
        - Reduce Permissions often
        - Analyze cross account and permission process 
    

Detection:
----------

    - Configure
    - Monitor
    - Investigate
    - 

    - Turn on Logging
    - Analyze logs centrally
    - Manage the log lifecycle
    


    - observability
    - Automated behavioural Monitoring
    - Traceability is the Key
    - Health Monitoring


Investigating - figuring out what happend

    - Automatic Responses
    - Learn and prevent



Infra and Data:
---------------
 
    - Does your workload work as intended
    - Protecting Networks
    - Protecting Compute


    - Use subnets for layering
    - Control traffic between layers
    - Inspect and protect
    - Automate all controls
    - Automation is king

    - Safe processing
    - Manage vunerabilities
    - Reduce attack surface
    - Systems over people
    - Managed systems whenever possible - Efficiency
    - Automate all controls



    Data:
    -----

         - Classifitcation
         - Data at rest
         - Data in transit
         - Identify and locate data
         - Determine protection requirements
         - Map out data lifecycle
         - Automate identification and classification

         - Enforce encryption at rest
         - Managing encryption keys and policies
         - lockdown access controls
         - Keep people away from data ;)
         - Automate all controls

         - Enforce encryption at transit
         - Manage certificates and keys
         - Authenticate network paths


Incident Response:
-----------------

    - Workload works only as Incident
    - if not, that may kickoff an Incident
    - Educate,prepare and simulate


    - Identify the key players
    - Create and incident reponse Plan
    - Pre-provision access
    - Get the tools ready
    - Setup forensics ahead of time


    - Run game days
    - Find rough spots
    - Iterate
